Google.com homepage
- First project HTML/ CSS
- Test for Odin Project responsive web design
- just look like it, not actually function like it

What I've learned:
- Difference id# & class.
- Float left right
- Hover
- Button
- Footer
- Display: inline;
- External CSS, Internal CSS and Inline CSS


What I could have done better:
- HTML layout (head, body, nav, span, link...)(still confusing)
- Spacing elements on the page
